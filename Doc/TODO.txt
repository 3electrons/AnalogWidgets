Some other things I thought it would be nice to implement. 

- Make widgetwithbackground transparent it means suitable to use it as a
seftstanding window for desktop widgets with non standard size 


- think over is widgetwithbackground is a good approach

- add abstractcheck as a abstract class for all kind of switches and so on. 


- Use QCachePixmap -- to reduce pixmap buffering used by widgetwithbackground 

- Create SvgWidgetWithBackground - cache as well resources for drawing
resources into widgetwithbackground 

- Create timer driven interface to the abstractmeter -- that refresh widget
only every 50 [ms] if widget indication is changed rapidly 

- The most important and the most difficult - brand new chart component.
with themes for each part as a plugins
